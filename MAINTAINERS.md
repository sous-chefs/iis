# Maintainers

This file lists how this cookbook project is maintained. When making changes to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need a review from an existing maintainer for the cookbook to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.

Check out [How Cookbooks are Maintained](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/community_cookbook_documentation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD) for details on the process and how to become a maintainer or the project lead.
